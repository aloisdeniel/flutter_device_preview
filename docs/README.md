## Limitations

Think of Device Preview as a first-order approximation of how your app looks and feels on a mobile device. With Device Mode you don't actually run your code on a mobile device. You simulate the mobile user experience from your laptop, desktop or tablet.

!> There are some aspects of mobile devices that Device Preview will never be able to simulate. When in doubt, your best bet is to actually run your app on a real device.
