## Main features

* Preview any device from any device
* Change the device orientation
* Dynamic system configuration (*language, dark mode, text scaling factor, ...)*
* Freeform device with adjustable resolution and safe areas
* Keep the application state
* Plugin system (*Screenshot, File explorer, ...*)
* Customizable plugins

## Quickstart

Wrap your app's root widget in a `DevicePreview` and inject the dedicated `builder` and `locale` into your app.

> Make sure to provide `locale` and `builder` to your `WidgetsApp`. If not defined, `MediaQuery` won't be simulated for the selected device and selected locale won't be applied.

```dart
import 'package:device_preview/device_preview.dart';

void main() => runApp(
  DevicePreview(
    enabled: !kReleaseMode,
    builder: (context) => MyApp(), // Wrap your app
  ),
);

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      locale: DevicePreview.locale(context), // Add the locale here
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder, // Add the builder here
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Limitations

Think of Device Preview as a first-order approximation of how your app looks and feels on a mobile device. With Device Mode you don't actually run your code on a mobile device. You simulate the mobile user experience from your laptop, desktop or tablet.

!> There are some aspects of mobile devices that Device Preview will never be able to simulate. When in doubt, your best bet is to actually run your app on a real device.
